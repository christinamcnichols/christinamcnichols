- 👋 Hi, I’m @christinamcnichols
- 👀 I’m looking for my first job in software development after completing my Bachelor's degree (8/2023)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and working on a AWS certification. After that is a long list of others but next will be TypeScript and MongoDB.
- 💞️ I’m looking for any advice on how to land my first job in this field, I've been applying for internships and entry level positions but no luck yet. I've been dividing my time between learning and applying for jobs.
